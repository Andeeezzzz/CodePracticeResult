Basically, this app is a app that will help you train your reflexes. 

There will be 3 views: A main menu, a Game View, A settings view, and a instructions view.

The main menu will be the most simple, just a menu screen with 2 buttons leading the Game View and Instructions view. 
I wiil do this with NavigationLink and NavigationView

The Instructions view will also be simple, having only text explaining how to play the game.

There will also be a settings view, where you can change how big the Grid is and such.

The game view is the most complicated. It will contain a grid of squares, and these squares will light up and random. The goal of the game is to click as many 
lit-up squares as you can in the amount of time you set in the settings page,

Each time you click on a lit up square, you will gain a certain amount of coins / gold. You can use these coins to buy skins for the game, such as 
custom tiles and such. You can also buy things like power-ups (Double gold for 1 round 1 extra life, ETC)

If you click on a tile that is NOT lit up, you will lose a life. You can either set it to easy (5 hearts), normal (3 hearts), or hardcore (1 heart). You can buy 
extra life power ups from the shop.
